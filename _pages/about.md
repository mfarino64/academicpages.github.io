I am a graduate student at <a href="https://phy.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Princeton University</a> interested in particle physics. As an undergraduate at the <a href="https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh</a>, I worked with <a href="https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/people/vladimir-savinov" target="_blank">Professor Vladimir Savinov</a> on a project searching for rare decays of B mesons to charmed baryons in data collected at the <a href="https://belle.kek.jp/" target="_blank">Belle Experiment</a>. I am passionate about outreach and learning new things about the world.

I would like to thank you for happening upon my little corner of the internet. I know it seems a bit desolate at the moment. This website is far from its final form, and I hope to add more sections that succinctly cover my research, outreach, personal projects, etc. Anyways, I hope you enjoy your stay. Feel free to contact me, especially if you have an idea for what else to include on this page!

Cheers,

Mark
