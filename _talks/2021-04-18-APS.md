This is my presentation from the American Physical Society (APS) April Meeting in 2021. 

Abstract: "We search for new Cabibbo-suppressed decays of B mesons to neutral charmed baryons and report the current status of the analysis based on the full Belle data sample. These decays could be used to validate the models describing hadronic dynamics and, with a larger data sample,to search for baryon number violation arising via the charmed baryons oscillations. We discuss the analysis procedure, background suppression optimization, the approach used to separate between similar channels, and present preliminary results based on data."
