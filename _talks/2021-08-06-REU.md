Here are the 3 progress reports and final talk I presented as a participant in the University of Michigan-CERN Research Experience for Undergraduates (<a href="https://cern-reu.physics.lsa.umich.edu/" target="_blank">UM-CERN-REU</a>) in 2021. My project used machine learning to optimize data compression methods that will be employed on the <a href="https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms" target="_blank">CMS</a> detector as part of the <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/high-luminosity-lhc" target="_blank">High-Luminosity LHC upgrade</a>. You can read more about it <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2779299?ln=en" target="_blank">here</a>. The slides of my final talk are viewable below.
